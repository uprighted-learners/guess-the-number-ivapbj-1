### This file was created in lieu of the missing or deleted feedback pull request and is intended to mark the regrading of the resubmission that occurred on May 28th ###

Functionality:
  Changes: Index.js Cheat Detection was implemented with upper and lower bounds being enforced correctly, however the player can stil lie about the computer guessing correctly
  Suggestions: Ensure that your code checks to see if the computer's guess matches the number the user set, if it does not, then ensure the user is informed of their dubious actions
Overall Score: 2/3 -> 2.5/3

Readability:
  Changes:Added more and more specific commenting
  Suggestions: I would encourage you to remove some of the commented out code that you have within your files (as it is so minimal [being only a handful of lines], I will not be counting it against you)
Overall Score: 2/3 -> 3/3

Organization:
  NO CHANGES

### FINAL SCORE: 8.5/9 ###
